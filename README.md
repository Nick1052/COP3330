Final OOP project: NicolasGonzalezProject
    
    ->Description: Final OOP project. This project involves using various different classes to solve a real world problem. I decided to make a
    program that would create a database for a mechanic shop. This problem is intended to fix a real problem that a mechanic shop owner I know has, the mechanic shop is known as Sowma and it is based in Miami.
    This database uses an ArrayList for a database storage since the project did not ask for something too intricate, SQL could be used to improve the database.
